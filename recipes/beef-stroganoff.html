            <li>
                Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into 
                strips 1/2 inch thick by 2 inches long. 
                Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large skillet over medium heat, 
                melt the butter and brown the beef strips quickly, 
                then push the beef strips off to one side. 
                Add the onions and cook slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, 
                then push to the side with the beef strips.

                Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. 
                Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. 
                Lower the heat and stir in mustard. 
                Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.
